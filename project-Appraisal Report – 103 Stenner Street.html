          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This project was completed as part of my coursework for the AGB 376
            Rural Property Appraisal class at California Polytechnic State
            University. The goal was to conduct a comprehensive appraisal of a
            multi-unit residential property located at 103 Stenner Street in San
            Luis Obispo, CA. I employed three key valuation methods: the cost
            approach, income approach, and sales comparison approach. Through
            detailed analysis, I developed a final market value estimate of
            $2,100,000, earning an A for this project.

          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>
            The property at 103 Stenner Street is a nine-bedroom, nine-bathroom
            apartment house located in a student-dense neighborhood near
            California Polytechnic State University. In this project, I analyzed
            the property’s value using standard appraisal techniques, which
            involved reviewing its physical condition, market potential, and
            zoning regulations. I also considered its rental income potential,
            the surrounding real estate market, and replacement costs.
            Ultimately, the appraisal concluded with a market value of
            $2,100,000 as of May 1, 2025. The analysis highlighted both the
            strong rental demand in the area and potential risks related to cash
            flow and competition.
