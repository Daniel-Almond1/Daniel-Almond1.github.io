          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            For my senior project I chose to compete in the Cal Poly Affordable Housing Competition. Together with a small team of related majors we created a 75 unit apartment building meant to be 100% affordable for the county of San Luis Obispo. This was challenging as there are specific requirements and guidelines that make affordable building more complex than market rate housing.

          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>
            Broadleaf Flats is a 75-unit affordable housing development proposed for San Luis Obispo’s historic Little Italy neighborhood, designed to serve small families, young professionals, and low-income residents earning 20–60% of the Area Median Income. The 1.25-acre site at 2900 Broad St. offers studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, with amenities including a central courtyard, daycare, community room, and on-site laundry. Prioritizing sustainability, the project uses mass timber construction, solar energy systems, and passive design strategies to reduce costs and environmental impact. With a total development cost of $55.6 million, Broadleaf Flats is financed through a blend of LIHTC equity, public grants, and affordable housing loans. The project supports walkable, transit-oriented living with direct access to SLO Transit and is expected to generate strong long-term financial performance with a projected DSCR of 1.15.
