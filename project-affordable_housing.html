            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
              This project, simply put, involved turning years of raw monthly
              real estate data into usable insights about the residential
              sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started with nine Excel files, each representing a different
              real estate sector, and each containing three columns: date, price
              return, and income return. I added two more columns for better
              organization. After organizing the data, step two was to create
              average return by decade tables, which calculated the average
              price return and income return for each decade. Once this was
              done, I repeated the process to measure volatility in price and
              income returns by decade. After completing this for all nine
              sectors, I created three graphs to summarize these findings for
              each sector.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Graph of Income and Price Return:</strong> This type of
                graph compares trends in income and price returns, helping to
                visualize the relationship between stable income streams and
                more fluctuating price changes over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Returns by Decade:</strong> These graphs break down
                average returns by decade to show long-term trends and highlight
                how different time periods compare in terms of performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Income and Price Volatility:</strong> Volatility graphs
                provide insight into the stability of income and price returns
                by measuring how much they fluctuate over specific periods.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The final steps of this project were to build a correlation matrix
              between sectors and create a summary graph to identify which
              sectors stood out the most. These final analyses helped tie
              everything together by showing relationships between sectors and
              highlighting outliers.
