        <h3>My Dance Journey</h3>
        <p class="text-black">
          I started dancing at a large studio in Santa Rosa, California, called
          Nordquist. As a 7th grader, I would dress up in a suit and tie for my
          lessons on Tuesday nights. The classes had 200â€“300 kids in one large
          hall, so there were plenty of junior instructors to help teach. Mr.
          Nordquist would teach us a new step every Tuesday, and at Nordquist I
          learned the box step (Rumba), Cha Cha, East Coast Swing, Night Club
          Two-Step, and others.
          <br /><br />
          After two years in Mr. Nordquist's classes, I tried out to become a
          junior dance instructor. Junior dance instructors started in 7th grade
          in Mr. Nordquistâ€™s class, and after completing the second-year course,
          you could apply to become one. The small group of junior instructors
          helped teach the other two classesâ€”7th graders and 8th gradersâ€”every
          Tuesday. We also performed 5â€“7 routines together during both the
          spring dance and the graduation dance! This experience impacted not
          only my dance knowledge but also my etiquette on the dance floor. Mr.
          Nordquist made a habit of teaching proper etiquette to young students,
          like how to help a lady with her coat or seat her properly.
          <br /><br />
          After graduating high school, I applied to use my dance knowledge at a
          local Arthur Murray studio. While I was unfamiliar with the full scope
          of the Arthur Murray program, the idea of being paid to teach was very
          attractive to me. Once I joined the staff, I quickly realized ballroom
          dancing was much more vast than I had ever imagined. I began studying
          syllabi and learning dances I had never heard of before, expanding my
          skills in areas like teaching methods, choreography, and private
          lesson handling. Arthur Murray provided me with valuable access to
          professionals in the ballroom dance world, allowing me to receive
          personal coaching and advice. I became a top teacher and competitor in
          my district in the "Future Champions" category and became certified
          twice at the full Bronze level in their syllabus.
          <br /><br />
          In 2022, I left Arthur Murray to finish my degree in Business
          Administration and Computer Science. I chose Cal Poly for my
          undergraduate studies, and as soon as I arrived on campus, I found the
          ballroom club and began attending club meetings regularly. With the
          experience I carried from Arthur Murray, they asked if I could teach
          some classes, and I started teaching for Cal Poly Ballroom.
          <br /><br />
          During my second year at Cal Poly, I connected with a local studio
          that used the DVIDA (Dance Vision International Dance Association)
          syllabus, which is known for its structured curriculum in ballroom
          dance. They asked if I would like to teach some lessons, and I soon
          realized I was one of only three teachers who knew how to teach a
          private lesson. I asked the studio owner if she had ever run a teacher
          training program, and she hadnâ€™t. Together, we created a teacher
          training platform and implemented it. We worked really hard on this,
          and it gave me real insight into what running a studio is actually
          like.
          <br /><br />
          Today, I hope to continue teaching and working in the dance
          spaceâ€”maybe one day even open a studio of my own.
