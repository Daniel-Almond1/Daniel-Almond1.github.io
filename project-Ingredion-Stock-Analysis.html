          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, we were tasked with selecting a publicly traded company and conducting a comprehensive stock analysis using key financial and strategic metrics learned in Advanced Corporate Finance. This included evaluating the company’s financial health through ratios like ROE, profit margin, quick ratio, and times-interest-earned, alongside broader tools such as SWOT analysis, competitor benchmarking, and beta evaluation. Overall, this project taught me how to assess a company from multiple angles, deepening my understanding of investment performance, industry positioning, and capital structure analysis.

          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>
            This project focused on Ingredion Inc. (NYSE: INGR), a leading ingredient solutions provider operating in over 120 countries. Our team analyzed the company’s financial statements, evaluated its position within the ingredient and food manufacturing industry, and compared its performance to competitors like Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains, and Bunge. Through ratio analysis, market insights, and quarterly performance trends, we concluded that while Ingredion offers relative stability, its low volatility and modest returns present limited upside. We ultimately recommended a cautious approach for bullish investors, noting risks in cash flow, regulatory pressure, and competition.
